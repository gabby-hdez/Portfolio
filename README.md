PORTFOLIO HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

For this assignemtn we had to create a portfolio page with HTML and CSS. We were given acceptance criteria for the portfolio that we had to meet. 

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Steps to create the Portfolio:
1. The first step was to create the HTML code for the Portfolio. In the HTML it was a requirement to link the HTML file to the CSS file and the Reset file. We also needed to be sure that the reset file was before the CSS file.

2. After the HTML file had all the necessary information including our name, photo, links to the sections about them, our work and our contact information.

3. Once the HTML code was complete, the next step was to create our Reset code. The Reset code for our page is to set the default settings of the CSS.

4. After the Reset code was done, it was tiume to start the CSS code. In the CSS code, the flex boxes were created so our page could look neat and organized. Pseudo-classes were also created when hovering over certain texts/boxes.

5. In the CSS code, code was also added for resizing the page on various screens and devices.
